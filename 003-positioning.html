      <h1>Positioning</h1>
      <p>There are a number of different ways to control position of content on a page using HTML/CSS.</p>
      <p>It's important to learn how to use each technique individually, however, in many instances,
        it takes a combination of CSS properties in order to gain the precise control
        you need to build a well laid-out page.</p><br>

      <h2>CSS PROPERTY #1: Display</h2>
      <p>Each element on a webpage fills a rectangular box of space. The display
        property sets how that box is treated by the web browser that reads and
        interprets your code, building the view you see on your screen when you
        visit a web page.</p>
      <p>The two most important values of display are block and inline.</p>
      <p>Understanding the default values of HTML elements, as well as how and
        when to override these values, will help you understand how each element box works.</p><br>

      <h3>DISPLAY VALUE #1: Block</h3>
      <p>All container elements (header, nav, div, etc) are by default set to display
        as a block. Block elements stretch as wide as the container that they are placed in.
        Therefore, it is important to consider the size of the container an element
        is being placed inside of when determining how you would like to frame your content.
        As you build a web page, some block containers may be set to fill the full
        width of the page and others will be set to specific widths.</p><br>

        <h4>Block Rules:</h4>
        <ol>
          <li>If no width is set, it naturally expands to fill its parent container.</li>
          <li>If no height is set, it will naturally fit any elements within
            it—assuming they are not floated or positioned.</li>
          <li>Will be placed below existing elements—assuming they are not floated
            or positioned.</li>
          <li>Margins and/or padding can be applied.</li>
          <li>Ignores the vertical-align property.</li>
        </ol><br>

        <h3>DISPLAY VALUE #2: Inline</h3>
        <p>Inline elements are often found inside of block container elements.
          An inline element will accept margin and padding but the element still
          sits inline as you might expect. Margin and padding will only push
          other elements horizontally away, not vertically.
          An inline element will not accept height and width.
          Any height and width added to an inline element will be ignored.</p><br>

        <h4>Inline Rules:</h4>
        <ul>
          <li>Takes up only as much width as it needs, and does not force new lines.</li>
          <li>Flows along with the text content.</li>
          <li>Will not clear previous content to drop to the next line like block elements.</li>
          <li>Will ignore top and bottom margin settings, but will apply left and right margins,
            and any padding.</li>
          <li>Will ignore the width and height properties.</li>
          <li>If floated left or right, will automatically become a block-level
            element, subject to all block characteristics.</li>
          <li>Is subject to the vertical-align property.</li>
        </ul><br>

        <h3>DISPLAY VALUE #3: Inline Block</h3>
        <p>An element set to inline-block is very similar to an element set to
          inline in that it will set inline with the natural flow of text.
          The only difference is that you are able to set a width and height
          which will be respected within the line in which it's placed inside.</p><br>

        <h3>DISPLAY VALUE #4: Flex</h3>
        <p></p><br>

        <h2>CSS PROPERTY #2: Float</h2>
        <p>Using the float property on an element causes that element to be positioned
          as far left or right within its container as possible until it either runs
          into another element or runs into the container's defined limits.</p>
        <p>The float property is really important in web layouts by being used with two common techniques:
        Floating inline elements (like images) will force content (like text) to wrap around it.
        Floating block elements will slide one up alongside another.</p>
        <p>By default, all elements have their float set to none.
        The float property can be assigned a value of either left or right.
        Using a float takes the floated content out of the natural flow of the page
        making it especially important to consider the defined height and width
        of both content and container elements.</p><br>

        <h3>FLOAT ASIDE #1: The ClearFix Hack</h3>
        <p>It is important to recognize when using float based layouts that a float's
          container will not stretch down and around the height of the internal elements
          if the internal elements have a greater defined height and width than
          the container that they are positioned inside of.</p>
          <p>With today's web browsers, if you only need to target IE 8 and up,
            then this clear fix is widely accepted:</p>
          <code>
            .clearfix:after {<br>
              content: " ";<br>
              display: table;<br>
              clear: both;<br>
            }<br>
          </code>
          <p>This ClearFix "Hack" will cause the floated element's container element
            to stretch around the content inside it like you think it would.</p><br>

          <h2>CSS PROPERTY #3: Position</h2>
          <p>In order to make more complex layouts, the position property is needed
            to take elements out of the normal flow of the page. Elements can be moved
            around on a web page in various ways by setting the top, right, bottom and
            left positions. It's important to understand that these directional position
            values of the positioned element are from the reference of the position property
            that has been assigned to that element. When these properties are set on a
            positionable element, that element is referred to as a "positioned element".</p><br>

          <h3>POSITION VALUE #1: Static;</h3>
          <p>"Static" is the default position value of every element. Typically,
            an element with a static position is referred to as "not positioned"
            and will ignore any additional properties assigned to it that would
            move it from its current location. A static element is NOT positionable.</p><br>

          <h3>POSITION VALUE #2: Relative;</h3>
          <p>By setting the top, right, bottom, and/or left properties,
            a relative positioned element will be moved away from its normal location accordingly.
            The space that the element originally occupied will remain unchanged after the move.
            This means that other elements will NOT move into the relative positioned
            element's former location.</p><br>

          <h3>POSITION VALUE #3: Absolute;</h3>
          <p>An element given a position value of "absolute" will remove the element
            completely from the layout of the page's content and position it relative
            to the block element containing it. If the absolutely positioned element
            is not contained within another container element, it will be positioned
            relative to the main containing block, the &#60;html&#62; page. In contrast
            to a relatively positioned element, an absolutely positioned element will
            not leave a gap where the element was originally located on the page
            because absolutely positioning an element completely removes it
            from the layout of the content.</p><br>

          <h3>POSITION VALUE #4: Fixed;</h3>
          <p>An element given a position value of fixed will lock the element on
            the screen and not move it, even if the page is scrolled.
          Because an element with fixed position is always positioned apart
          from or on top of the general content of the webpage, it will not leave
          a gap in the content of the page, and will instead allow the static,
          relative, and absolute positioned elements below it.</p><br>

          <h2>CSS PROPERTY #4: Z-index;</h2>
          <p>When working with relative, absolute and fixed positioned elements,
            the z-index allows a stacking over order of which elements will be displayed;
            one over the other. It's important to note that z-index will only work
            on elements whose position property has been explicitly set to absolute,
            fixed, or relative.</p>
          <p>The higher the value given to the z-index property, the higher the
            stacking order the element will be placed.</p><br>


      <!-- content currently not used -->
      <!-- <p>The positioning of html page elements can be accomplished by using a wide array of CSS techniques.</p>
      <p>These techniques allow us to position the elements in relation to each other and with a variant distance.</p>
      <p>In addition, CSS also offers the flexibility of positioning elements as far or as close to one another and
        in some cases, on top or underneath each other.</p>
      <p>Different programmers use different techniques to positione elements around the page. </p>
      <p>The properties that are used to accomplish
        these goals are:</p>
      <ul class="mainSectionUl">
        <li>The floats of the elements and in combination to the element's width:<br>
          <code>&nbsp;div {float: left}&nbsp;</code>
        </li>
        <li>The z-index of the element in order to accomplish elevation<br>
          <code>&nbsp;span {z-index: 1;}&nbsp;</code>
        </li>
        <li>The display of the elements: <br>
          <code>&nbsp;article {display: table-cell;}&nbsp;</code>
        </li>
        <li>The position of the element which can be relative to the parent element
          or in a free format: <br>
          <code>&nbsp;span {position: absolute;}&nbsp;</code>
        </li>
      </ul> -->

      <h2>How was CSS used</h2>
      <ul class="mainSectionUl">
        <li>We used the <code>&nbsp;display: table&nbsp;</code> option to properly position the main sections of the page</li>
        <li>We used a <code>position: absolute</code> to be able to render the number
        in a place where it renders on top of other elements and is not confined by the parent tags</li>
        <li>We used a <code>display: block</code> for the footer of the page since we wanted to keep the footer in one line by itself</li>
      </ul>
