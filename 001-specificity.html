      <h1>Specificity</h1><br>
      <p>In the beginning days of the world wide web (WWW), documents or other information were often sent as simple plain text across the wires that formed the internet. Because the original intent was to allow scientists to share information at the particle accelerator <a href="http://home.cern/">CERN</a>, <a href="http://webfoundation.org/about/vision/history-of-the-web/">Sir Tim Berners-Lee</a>, the inventor of the WWW, developed the Hyper Text Markup Language (HTML) language we use today. HTML included the means to allow some basic formatting of the documents being shared. Once styling became more complex and CSS from a separate file was used to control the attributes of a webpage, there became a need for combining additional styling. By including some type of order and precedence we can keep CSS code DRY (don't repeat yourself). This increases readability for the developer while reducing the memory requirements on both the client and the server side, as well as during the transmission process.</p><br>
      <p>Currently, we have changed the font size of all of the paragraphs to a font size of 20 pixels and the text color to green from their browser specific values using the following code:</p><br>
      <code>
      p {
        color: green;
      	font-size: 20px;
      }
  </code><br><br>
      <p>This is obviously easier and less time consuming than setting the font size and color within each paragraph or 'p' tag in the HTML document.</p><br>
      <p>The ‘C’ in CSS stands for “cascading”. What this means is that all of the ‘styling’ defined within each style sheet cascades or flows from the top of the document down to the bottom. Then, the styling for each element can then be updated by changing or combining property values. An example is shown here where we have updated the properties of the following paragraphs by defining a separate class selector, called "example1" with the following properties and values using the following CSS code:</p><br>
      <code>.example1 {
      	color: blue;
      	font-size: 30px;
      }</code><br><br>
      </p><br>
      <p class="example1">The text color is now larger and blue (30 pixels), likewise, any other paragraphs that are also defined with the same class are rendered in the same way. For example the following paragraph.</p><br>
      <p class="example1">Now while this paragraph is still blue, because it is also defined by the 'example1' class, the next paragraph reverts back to our original 'p' element formatting, as the HTML for this paragraph does not belong to the 'example1' class.</p><br>
      <p>Now watch how the cascade works. In this next example, we first define the class for the following paragragh as blue. We then alter the cascade by setting the class that defines the following paragraphs to yellow with a font size of 40 pixels. Finally, we change the text to red, but leave the font size alone. What happens?</p><br>
      <code>
      .example2 {
          color: green;
          font-size: 20px;
      }
      .example2 {
          color: yellow;
          font-size: 40px;
      }
      .example2 {
          color: red;
      }
      </code></p><br>
      <p class="example2">Well, because the text color of red was the last one to be defined in the cascade, it took precedence over green and yellow. Moreover, the larger size 40 pixel font persisted, even though it was defined at the same time as the color was set to yellow (which we never see). This is an example of how the properties of an element can be altered downward in the cascade by resetting property values.</p>
