      <h1>Specificity</h1><br>
      <p>In the beginning days of the world wide web (WWW), documents or other
        information were often sent as simple plain text across the wires that
        formed the internet. <br>
        Because the original intent was to allow scientists to share information
        at the particle accelerator <a href="http://home.cern/">CERN</a>,
        <a href="http://webfoundation.org/about/vision/history-of-the-web/">Sir Tim Berners-Lee</a>,
        the inventor of the WWW, developed the Hyper Text Markup Language (HTML). <br>
        HTML included the means to allow some basic formatting of the documents
        being shared. </p>

        <p>Once styling became more complex and demanding, there was a need for
          a way that would allow the separation of the code that related to the
          styling of the page from the rest of the document. <br>
          CSS was introduced in order to satisfy this need. CSS files are used
          to control the attributes of a webpage, while the overall style of an html page
          is being managed through separate files. <br>
          By including some type of order and precedence we can keep CSS code DRY
          (don't repeat yourself). <br>
          This increases readability for the developer while reducing the memory
          requirements on both the client and the server side,
          as well as during the transmission process.</p><br>
        <p>Currently, we have changed the font size of all of the paragraphs to
          a font size of 20 pixels, a left padding of 10 pixels and the text color
          to green from their browser specific values using the following code:</p><br>
          <p>
            <code>
              p {<br>
              		color: green;<br>
              		font-size: 20px;<br>
              }<br>
          </code>
          </p>

        <p class="class-example1">In this and some of the following paragrahs,
          we have added a class named "class-example1": <br><code>&#60;p class="class-example1"&#62;</code><br>
          The text color is now larger and blue (30 pixels).
          Likewise, any other paragraphs that are also defined with the same class
          are rendered in the same way. For example the following paragraph.</p><br>
        <p class="class-example1">Now while this paragraph is still blue,
          because it is also defined by the 'class-example1' class, the next paragraph
          reverts back to our original 'p' element formatting, as the HTML for this
          paragraph does not belong to the 'class-example1' class.</p><br>
        <p>Now watch how the cascade works. In this next example, we first define
          the class for the following paragragh as blue. <br>
          We then alter the cascade by setting the class that defines the following
          paragraphs to yellow with a font size of 40 pixels. <br>
          Finally, we change the text to red, but leave the font size alone. What happens?</p><br>

          <code>
          p { <br>
          		color: green;<br>
          		font-size: 20px;<br>
          }<br>
<br>

          .class-example1 {<br>
          	color: blue;<br>
          	font-size: 30px;<br>
          }<br>
<br>

          .class-example2 {<br>
          	color: blue;<br>
          	font-size: 30px;<br>
          }<br>
<br>

          .class-example2 {<br>
          	color: yellow;<br>
          	font-size: 40px;<br>
          }<br>
<br>

          .class-example2 {<br>
          	color: red;<br>
          }<br>
      </code><br>
      <p class="class-example2">Well, because the text color of red was the last
        one to be defined in the cascade, it took precedence over green and yellow. <br>
        Moreover, the larger size 40 pixel font persisted, even though it was defined
        at the same time as the color was set to yellow (which we never see). <br>
        This is an example of how the properties of an element can be altered
        downward in the cascade by resetting property values.</p><br>
      <p class="class-example2">Lastly, we will now use another selector,
        the id to change the next paragraph to purple and the font size back to 20.</p><br><br>
      <code>
          p { <br>
          		color: green;<br>
          		font-size: 20px;<br>
          }<br>
<br>
          .class-example1 {<br>
          	color: blue;<br>
          	font-size: 30px;<br>
          }<br>
<br>
          .class-example2 {<br>
          	color: blue;<br>
          	font-size: 30px;<br>
          }<br>
<br>
          .class-example2 {<br>
          	color: yellow;<br>
          	font-size: 40px;<br>
          }<br>
<br>
          .class-example2 {<br>
          	color: red;<br>
          }<br>
<br>
          #id-example1 {<br>
          	color: purple;<br>
          	font-size: 20px;<br>
          }<br>
<br>
          .class-example3 {<br>
          	color: black;<br>
          	font-size: 20px;<br>
          }<br>
      </code><br><br>
      <p class="class-example2" id="id-example1">I'm different and unique.
        Even though I have the class defining me as red, I am purple because of
        my unique ID. From here on, we will go back to using black text.</p>
      <code>
        p { <br>
          color: green;<br>
          font-size: 20px;<br>
        }<br>
        <br>
        .class-example1 {<br>
          color: blue;<br>
          font-size: 30px;<br>
        }<br>
        <br>
        .class-example2 {<br>
          color: blue;<br>
          font-size: 30px;<br>
        }<br>
        <br>
        .class-example2 {<br>
          color: yellow;<br>
          font-size: 40px;<br>
        }<br>
        <br>
        .class-example2 {<br>
          color: red;<br>
        }<br>
        <br>
        #id-example1 {<br>
          color: purple;<br>
          font-size: 20px;<br>
        }<br>
        <br>
        .class-example3 {<br>
          font-size: 20px;<br>
          color: black;<br>
        }<br>
      </code>
      <br><br>
      <p class="class-example3">In the examples shown above, you see that we obtain
        specificity in our style sheets by different methods. <br>
        Once a style is defined for an element, in this case 'p', it will persist <br>
        unless othewise altered - lower down in the CSS document file. <br>
        Second, we have a heirachy of precedence. When using just the element as
        the selector in our CSS, we have assigned the lowest amount of weight for that style. <br>
        Classes have more weight than element tags when used as selectors, and therefore,
        the values defined by their properties will take precedence over that of those
        defined for the element tags. </p><br>
      <p class="class-example3">Lastly, ID's take precedence over classes,
        but also must be unique to a single element tag.<br>
        In fact, there is a numerical system to calculate specificity.
        The notation uses a system that starts with 0-0-0. <br>
        The element or 'type' selector scores 1 point on the right, which represents
        the lowest specificity weight, and would appear as 0-0-1. <br>
        Classes, which have more weight would score in the middle, or as 0-1-0.
        ID's score in the leftmost column, or as 1-0-0.<br>
        It should be noted that
        in-line HTML formatting takes even higher precedence than ID's, as well as the use of
        <a href="https://css-tricks.com/when-using-important-is-the-right-choice/">!important rule</a>
        within a selector's definition. <br>
        Moreover, because more advanced formatting can include combinations of selectors
        the weighting can become difficult to calculate. <br>
        Here is an awesome <a href="https://flukeout.github.io/">game</a>
        to learn how to combine selectors. once you concuer that, here is a fun online

  <!-- <section id="#interactiveSectionId">
    <p>The CSS that is added in an html document can be added in different categories of tags.</p>
    <p>When a css rule is applied in a particular tag, then that means that all the tags in the document
      are affected by the CSS rule.</p>
      <p>Therefore, if you would add a particular width property like: <code>div {width: 150px;}</code>,<br>
        that would mean that all the div tags in the document would have a width of 150 pixels.</p><br>
    <p>As a developer, you have the option of being more specific on which tags should get the settings you have defined.</p>
    <p>You can be more specific on which selectors get the properties you are working on by using:</p>
    <ul class="mainSectionUl">
      <li><u>A class property</u> in the event that you want some of the same tags to be styled in a particular way
        but you do not want all the tags with the same styling.</li>
      <li><u>An id property</u> in case you want only one specific tag to be styled in a particular way
        but you do not want other tags to have the same styling.</li>
    </ul>
    <br>
    <p>There are several occasions where tags have more than one classes and more than one ids applied to them.</p>
    <p>That is because we might be using different classes to accomplish different, overlapping or supplementing styling formats.</p>
    <p>In order to be able to define the styling of tags in a priority base,
    CSS uses a <u>specificity</u> weight.</p>
    <p>In short, specificity means that ids have more weight than classes, and classes have more weight than tags.</p><br>
    <p>For example, let's assume you have an <code>h2</code> tag that has the following structure:</p>
    <code>&#60;h2 class="redBoldClass" id="greenUnderlineId"&#62;</code>
    <p>And also let's assume that you have the following CSS code (dot is for classes, # is for ids)</p>
    <code>
      h2 {<br>
        color: yellow;<br>
        font-size: 30px;<br>
      } <br>
      <br>
      .redBoldClass { <br>
        color: red;<br>
        font-size: 25px; <br>
        font-weight: bold; <br>
      } <br>
      <br>
      #greenUnderlineId { <br>
        color: green; <br>
        font-size: 35px; <br>
        text-decoration: underline<br>
      } <br>
    </code>
    <p>The particular CSS tag would end up having a <code>green</code> color,
     a font size of <code>35px</code> and a text decoration of <code>underline</code>.</p>
    <p>That is because the ids have a greater weight in specificity.</p>
    <p>On the other hand, all the other <code>h2</code> tags that have the same class will inherit
    the properties from the <code>.redBoldClass</code>,
    while the <code>h2</code> tags that do not have and class or id attached to them,
    will inherit the properties from the CSS applied in the h2 tag.</p>
    <br>
    <h2>How was CSS used</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Nothing was added in this chapter.</li>
      <li>Where needed, the different tags were given class and id names.</li>
    </ul>
