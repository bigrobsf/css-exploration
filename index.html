      <h2>Introduction</h2>
      <p>Hello and welcome to the CSS Tutorial page.</p>
      <p>This is a basic tutorial about CSS and how we can use differet css settings
        to accomplish functionality and a visibly pleasing content.</p>
      <p>Before we begin with our CSS tutorial, we added some basic html elements in the page.
        These elements are some of the most common ones found in html pages. We are assuming that
      you already have some familiarity with html tags and how they are nested within each other.</p>
      <p>In this page, we have added some basic headers, nav tags, links, paragraphs and general structural tags.</p>
      <p>You will be able to see the css code that we will be entering by viewing the things
        entered in the <code>&#60;code&#62;</code> tag  and with a different character format.</p>
      <p>For the moment, this page is completely stripped of CSS and the only thing that
        renders is the lines of text that are being typed within the html document.
        As we progress through this tutorial, we will be adding new CSS rules and
        we will be moving things around in order to make our page more pleasing to view
        and more functional.</p>
      <p>Even though there is no CSS applied to the page, you can see that some formatting is already applied to it.
        This formatting comes from the browser's presets and it might be different
        from the presents of other browsers. that is why you see things like:</p>
        <ol>
          <li>The <code>&#60;h1&#62; and &#60;h2&#62;</code> tags of the page in a larger font size</li>
          <li>The fonts of the page being in a specific preset font format</li>
          <li>Some intentation between the text and the window's frame</li>
          <li>Spacing between the different paragraphs and the headers of the page</li>
        </ol>
        <h2>What is next</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>Use CSS to reset the presets of the browser's page</li>
          <li>Discuss about specificity</li>
        </ul>
